## Features

- Unit Selection for Lengths:

Multiple Length Units: Users can select from common length units such as:
Metric units: meters (m), kilometers (km), millimeters (mm), centimeters (cm)
Imperial units: feet (ft), inches (in), yards (yd), miles (mi)
Include easy-to-use dropdowns or search functionality for selecting both the input and output units.
- Real-Time Conversion:

Instant Feedback: As users enter a value, the app instantly calculates and displays the converted length value in the selected output unit.
This can be achieved by using Reactâ€™s state management to trigger re-renders whenever the input changes.
- Responsive Design:

Ensure the app adapts to various screen sizes, including mobile, tablet, and desktop devices.
Use CSS Grid or Flexbox for flexible layouts and media queries to handle different screen widths.
- User-Friendly Interface:

Input Fields: Provide a clean input box where users can type the length they want to convert.
Clear Button: A button that resets the input fields for a fresh conversion.
